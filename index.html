        <img src="photos/Resume Photo.jpg" alt="Liam Jakubowski" style="width:200px;height:auto;">

        <p>I am driven by a passion for <strong>problem-solving and connection</strong>. I believe that software engineering is one of the fastest and most accessible ways to distribute meaningful solutions to large groups of people. I want to build intuitive, secure, and long-lasting tools that guide and empower others.</p>

        <p>At the same time, I am a lifelong musician. I believe music connects people on a level that words alone cannot reach. Music teaches resilience, leadership, collaboration, and the ability to perform under pressure — skills that deeply inform my approach to both technology and life.</p>

        <p>In the future, I want to explore <strong>ethical AI integration, particularly within music and life-enriching experiences</strong>. My goal is to help bridge the gap between human creativity and intelligent systems in a way that uplifts communities and builds stronger connections.</p>

    <!-- Mission Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Why Software & Music</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about <strong>problem-solving through software</strong> because it’s a powerful way to create scalable, affordable, and widely accessible solutions. Software connects industries, people, and ideas — it holds our modern world together.</p>

        <p>I am equally passionate about <strong>music’s ability to connect people without words</strong>. In music, you must strive for excellence every time — there is no “80% performance.” That drive has shaped my reliability, my leadership, and my ability to perform under pressure.</p>

        <p>Through both software and music, I aim to build systems that <strong>connect, empower, and inspire people</strong>.</p>
